In shadows deep, where secrets creep,  
A scholar roams, his mind to keep.  
Among the streets, in alleys wide,  
He seeks the truth where others hide.  
  
His books are torn, his pages worn,  
Yet in his heart, no hope is torn.  
With every word, with every thought,  
A world unfolds, a dream once sought.  

In cracked and crumbling, faded walls,  
He reads aloud, though silence calls.  
A mind in chains, yet still it flies,  
Beyond the reach of cruelest skies.  

The streets are cold, the night is near,  
But in his soul, there is no fear.  
A ghetto scholar, dark and wise,  
He battles fate with quiet sighs.  

Though wealth may come to pass him by,  
The light within shall never die.  
For knowledge, like the moonâ€™s pale glow,  
Shines bright, though darkness comes below.
