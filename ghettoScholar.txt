In the hollow of the night where the winds do moan and sigh, a scholar drifts through ruin's lair beneath the starless, somber sky; his books are worn, their spines now frayed, yet wisdom clings to every page, and though the world may scorn his name, his mind ascends, a torch aflame; the shadows whisper doubts and fears, the echoes haunt with bygone years, yet still he walks, with purpose strong, to weave his sorrow into song; for in the ghetto's bleak domain, where darkness falls like endless rain, he claims the right to think and dream, to forge his path against the stream, and though the night may coldly chide, the fire within will not subside.
