Hello my name is Christopher Lee Chun. 
I would like to show you my special program
that I have been working on. It uses magic squares to
encrypt messages. How cool is that. Magic squares and cubes 
have always been a source of wonder and amazement for me. 
I hope you find this program useful or fun. If you want to
collaborate with me on futurue projects my github is
4michael1angelo5.github.io. I hope to hear from y'all soon. 
Peace!
